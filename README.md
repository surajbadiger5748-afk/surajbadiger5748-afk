# Hi, I'm Suraj Badiger 👋  

## 👨‍💻 About Me  
I’m a backend engineer passionate about building reliable microservices with **Java + Spring Boot** and crafting clean UIs with **Angular v16**.  
Currently, I’m working on an **e-commerce platform (monolith → microservices)** with features like product search, autosuggestions, user management, and an admin dashboard.  

I also maintain a **DSA repository**, where every problem is explained from **Brute → Better → Optimal**, including examples and iterations.  
Fun fact: I debug best with a cup of chai ☕ and cricket on in the background 🏏.
